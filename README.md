### Overview

#### What we are looking for (taken from assignment)
- [X] **Simple, clear, readable code** 
I tried to keep the code as clean as possible
-  [x] **Correctness**
I do believe there will be bugs in the program.
- [ ] **Security** Was not developed with security in mind.
- [x] **Memory efficiency** I used the FS to free up the memory when ever it's not in use
- [ ] **Testing** Not great coverage did just the basics
- [x] **Documentation** There are plenty of documentation in that project 

## Nice To Have
- [x] Implementation for any CI tool for the project.
- [ ] Project Dockerization (ran out of time).
